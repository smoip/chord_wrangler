# Chord Wrangler
=========

## About:
Simple algorithmic ostinato generation for use with an external synthesis program.
Chord Wrangler generates music in the form of a string of MIDI note numbers based on an initial chord and then applies randomly selected chord transformations and voice leading operations to create phrases, sections, and ultimately a complete 'score'.  The resulting MIDI nn's can be fed into a synthesis program to realize an organically derived arpeggiated ostinato.  It should sound pretty cool.  Still very much in progress.

## Usage:
currently command line only
$ ruby make_chords.rb
